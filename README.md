Hello, my name is Betti Abbattista, I am 22. I am a fresh graduate in the bachelor's degree of Cinema and Media. 🎥🎬
I am passionate about animated content and CGI. 💻👩‍💻 I've been working at the MAD Entertainment animation studio for three years, as a tool developer and occasionally rigger and technical artist. 🎨🔢

In this profile repositories of tools developed and mantained for MAD in these years can be found: 

https://github.com/Betti83771/MAD_tools_for_Blender3,

https://github.com/Betti83771/BlenderBoneMerger

There are other repositories of older code that is unused at the moment.


Check out my Blender Projects profile, where I have my Blender C/C++ repository with my own branches: 🌿
